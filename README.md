This is my sumbission for the course project of the Getting and Cleaning
Data course on Coursera. The run\_analysis.R script does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
=============================================================

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
=======================================================================================

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
======================================================================

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
==================================================================

From the data set , creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of \#each variable for each activity and each subject.
=======================================================================================================================================

The end result is presented in the file tidy.txt.
